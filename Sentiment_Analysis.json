        "original_review": "I’ve had the pleasure of testing out the Boat Air Dopes Bluetooth headset, and I must say, I’m thoroughly impressed. From its build quality to its performance, this device exceeded my expectations in many ways.\nLet’s start with the basics: sound quality. The Boat Air Dopes deliver crisp, clear sound with rich bass that truly elevates the listening experience. Whether I’m jamming out to my favorite tunes or taking calls on the go, the audio quality never disappoints. The clarity and depth of sound are simply remarkable, especially considering the price point of these earbuds.\nConnectivity is another area where the Boat Air Dopes shine. Pairing them with my Android device was a breeze, and the connection has been rock solid ever since. Even when I tested them with my iPhone, I was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed. While there may be a slight lag compared to pricier alternatives like AirPods, it’s hardly noticeable in everyday use. Plus, the extended Bluetooth range means I can roam freely without worrying about losing connection.\nBattery life is always a concern with wireless earbuds, but the Boat Air Dopes deliver impressive longevity. I can go hours without needing to recharge, making them perfect for long commutes, workouts, or just daily use. And when it’s time to juice them up, the included charging case makes it quick and convenient.\nOne feature that truly sets the Boat Air Dopes apart is their design. Sleek and stylish, these earbuds not only look great but also fit comfortably in my ears. The ergonomic design ensures a snug fit, so they stay put no matter how active I am. Plus, they’re lightweight and discreet, making them ideal for wearing on the go.\nOverall, I can’t recommend the Boat Air Dopes enough. Whether you’re an Android user looking for top-notch performance or an iPhone user in search of a more budget-friendly option, these earbuds have you covered. With their superb sound quality, reliable connectivity, and impressive battery life, they’re a solid choice for anyone in the market for a new Bluetooth headset. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed.",

You're left with two default EQ presets that you can change with touch controls.\nThe noise suppression is too aggressive and the mic doesn't sound that great. But it's fine for this price range and it suppresses and good amount of noise. Good for calls but nor for meetings or anything that demands quality.\nTouch controls are horrible on these headphones to a point I wish there was just an option to just turn them off. I almost always trigger them when I take them out of the case. It almost never activates properly when I actually want it to or you have to keep retrying. The touch and hold actions don't always trigger and you lift your finger only to find out it recognized what you did as a touch action and pauses/plays.",

The performance is also impressive. The only drawback I experienced is the Strap of the watches. They are very thin and not of the quality assured by the vendor. The hooks of the strap are fallen down after 2 time use and I have gone for a replacement of the strap locally. The Rose gold plating was gone by 3 days (in fact 3 times) use. Each time about 3 to 4 hrs I have used this watch. S.Steel watch is OK. Any one who is interested to have fun with change of watches frequently for party purpose can buy these watches and enjoy its performance. If the Company improves a bit in the quality of the straps and Case of the watch it will be the best alternative to the CASIO. Good luck guys.",

What I was looking for in my smart watch was to have excellent call, answer features. Meaning that I can hear a conversation on my smart watch without having to hold it to my ear and the other party could hear me without sounding like I'm far away from the phone or have it muffled. The only other thing I was looking for basically in my smart watch would be sleep tracking and step counting. And with this \"NOISE\" Brand, I've finally found the one for me. I can hear conversations very clearly. Even outside course it cannot be extremely loud, but you can hear better than all the other ones I've tested out. And every conversation that I've had if I asked the other party, if they hear me clearly they definitely can. I do believe this watch also has noise canceling technology. That's definitely a plus. That makes the conversation between you and the other person sound as if you're on a regular house phone. I'm so glad I found this brand.",
